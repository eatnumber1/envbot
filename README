envbot - A modular IRC bot in bash
==================================
envbot is a modular irc bot coded in bash.

Features include:
 * SSL
 * IPv6
 * Transport (ssl, whatever) to server are also modules
 * Modularity
 * Loading, unloading and reloading of modules at runtime
 * Rehashing at runtime
See TODO for other planed features

Dependencies
------------
* bash - version 3.x should work fine, but not tested on anything below 3.2
* Standard POSIX tools. Should be included on any recent and sane Linux
  distro.

Some transports and module have extra dependencies. Note that when it says
"you need the program" just having the library won't work. You actually need
a program with this name.
Transports:
	dev-tcp:
		The bash you use must support the psedo device /dev/tcp. Debian is known
		to disable this. Most other distros are sane and have it on.
	gnutls:
		You need the program gnutls-cli. (http://www.gnutls.org/)
	openssl:
		You need the program openssl. (http://www.openssl.org/)
	stunnel:
		The bash you use must support the psedo device /dev/tcp. Debian is known
		to disable this. Most other distros are sane and have it on.
		You need the program stunnel. (http://stunnel.mirt.net/)
Modules:
	factoids
		You need the program sqlite3. (http://www.sqlite.org/)

Installing
----------
There is no installation.

All you have to do is to get the bot running is:
 * Copy bot_settings.sh.example to bot_settings.sh
 * Edit bot_settings.sh to set correct nick, 
   irc server, service password, and so on.
 * Run ./envbot

 * Loading, unloading and reloading of modules at runtime
 * Rehashing configuration at runtime
 * Advanced access control
See http://envbot.org/trac/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&type=enchantment&order=priority for other planed features


Installing
----------
See the file INSTALL.


License
-------
envbot is licensed under GPL version 3, with the exception of data/quotes.txt.example.pqf:
The source (games-misc/fortune-mod-pqf/fortune-mod-pqf-6.0.ebuild from Gentoo portage)
says it is under GPL-2.


Dependencies
------------
* bash - version 3.2.x should work fine, but not tested on anything below 3.2.17
* Standard POSIX tools. Should be included on any recent and sane Linux
  distro.

Some transports and module have extra dependencies. Note that when it says
"you need the program" just having the library won't work. You actually need
a program with this name.
Transports:
	dev-tcp:
		The bash you use must support the pseudo device /dev/tcp. Debian is known
		to disable this. Most other distros are sane and have it on.
	netcat:
		You need the program netcat.
		This is for Debian users and others with a broken distro. If your
		distro supports it use dev-tcp transport instead.
		I have only tested with GNU netcat. (http://netcat.sourceforge.net/)
		Supports binding to a specific IP.
	gnutls:
		You need the program gnutls-cli. (http://www.gnutls.org/)
	openssl:
		You need the program openssl. (http://www.openssl.org/)
	socat:
		You need the program socat. (http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/)
		Note that while socat support IPv4, IPv6, SSL and non-SSL it doesn't
		support both SSL and IPv6 at the same time if the version of socat
		is lower than 1.5.
		Supports binding to a specific IP.
Modules:
	sqlite3
		You need the program SQLite3. (http://www.sqlite.org/)
	factoids
		This depends on the SQLite3 module and therefore have the
		same dependencies as it
	seen
		This depends on the SQLite3 module and therefore have the
		same dependencies as it


Contributed modules
-------------------
These are extra modules in contrib/modules. They are not really
supported by the developers. Information about dependencies and
extra configuration options is in each contrib module.

If you want to use a contrib module the recommended way is:
  cd modules
  ln -s ../contrib/modules/m_modulename.sh
That way if the contrib module is updated you will get the new
version automatically.

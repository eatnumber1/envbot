envbot - A modular IRC bot in bash
==================================
envbot is a modular irc bot coded in bash.

Features include:
 * SSL
 * IPv6
 * Modularity
 * Loading, unloading and reloading of modules at runtime
See TODO for other planed features

Dependencies
------------
* bash - version 3.x should work fine, but not tested on anything below 3.2
* Standard POSIX tools. Should be included on any recent and sane Linux
  distro.

Some transports and module have extra dependencies:
Transports:
	dev-tcp:
		The bash you use must support the psedo device /dev/tcp. Debian is known
		to disable this. Most other distros are sane and have it on.
	gnutls:
		You need the program gnutls-cli.
	openssl:
		You need the program openssl.
	stunnel:
		The bash you use must support the psedo device /dev/tcp. Debian is known
		to disable this. Most other distros are sane and have it on.
		You need the program stunnel.


Installing
----------
There is no installation.

All you have to do is to get the bot running is:
 * Copy bot_settings.sh.example to bot_settings.sh
 * Edit bot_settings.sh to set correct nick, 
   irc server, service password, and so on.
 * Run ./envbot

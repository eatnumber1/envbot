# A transport module using netcat

# A list of features supported
# These are used: ipv4, ipv6, ssl, nossl, bind
# Yes I know some versions of netcat support encryption and some
# other ones support IPv6. I used GNU netcat and I couldn't find
# a way to detect what is supported in current netcat.
# Also those other netcat variants require you to pass some command
# line argument to enable use of IPv6. (nc6 doesn't)
# netcat got to many problems, use either dev-tcp or socat for
# non-SSL transport really!

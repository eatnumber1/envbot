Module API
==========

This file contains info needed to write a module.


Variables
---------
All bash variables in the module that are global MUST follow the format
module_modulename_variablename to prevent overwriting other modules, or
global bot variables. FAQ module may use: module_faq_last_query for example
as a variable.

Variables that are local to the function (using the local directive) may have
other names. Don't forget variables created in for loops and such
(for foo in bar bash; do echo $foo; done the $foo variable is global here,
 do local foo on the line before it)


Functions and hooks
-------------------
Hooks are functions with special names, as listed below in the section "The hooks".

Each function or hook should start with the module_ followed by the module name.
So if the module is faq.sh the modules should start with module_faq_ like module_faq_INIT.

All bash functions in the module MUST follow the format
module_modulename_functionname to prevent overwriting other modules, or
global bot functions.

If not mentioned otherwise the hook is optional.
Functions marked with TODO may change, get renamed or removed and may not work
even in current code.


The hooks
---------
module_modulename_INIT (REQUIRED)
	Called directly after loading the module.
	No parameters.
	If return code isn't 0 the module is considered as failed to load.
	The module should clean up after itself in this case before it returns
	from INIT.
	On STDOUT should be returned a space separated list of the optional functions
	that the module implements. FAQ would return "before_connect on_PRIVMSG"


module_modulename_UNLOAD (REQUIRED)
	Called to make the module unload itself.
	In this function it should clean up after itself and undefine all
	it's functions and variables except the REQUIRED functions.
	The unload function and other REQUIRED functions will be undefined
	after unload finished.
	The module may or may not get reloaded after this.
	No parameters
	Return code:
		0 = Unloaded correctly
		1 = Failed to unload. On this the bot will quit.


module_modulename_REHASH (REQUIRED) (TODO)
	Called to make the module reparse any config options.
	No parameters
		0 = Rehashed correctly
		1 = Non fatal error for the bot itself. The bot will call UNLOAD on the module.
		2 = Fatal error of some kind. On this the bot will quit.


module_modulename_FINALISE
	Called directly before the bot quits. The bot has already closed
	the connection to the IRC server at this point. This is for saving
	stuff.
	No parameters.
	Return code isn't checked.


module_modulename_after_load
	Called after all the hooks are added for the module.
	No parameters
	Return code not checked.
	Note: This is useful for stuff that needs to echo log messages
	      as that can't be done in modulename_INIT.


module_modulename_before_connect
	Called before the bot connected.
	No parameters
	Return code not checked.


module_modulename_on_connect
	Called for each line that the bot
	receives from the server during connecting.
	$1 = raw line.
	Return code not checked.


module_modulename_after_connect
	Called after the bot connected.
	No parameters
	Return code not checked.


module_modulename_on_PRIVMSG
	Called when bot gets a PRIVMSG
	$1 = from who (n!u@h)
	$2 = to who (channel or botnick)
	$3 = the message
	Return code:
		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.


module_modulename_on_NOTICE
	Called when bot gets a NOTICE
	$1 = from who (n!u@h)
	$2 = to who (channel or botnick)
	$3 = the message
	Return code:
		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.


module_modulename_on_NICK

	Called when someone changes nick in a channel the bot is in
	$1 = from who (n!u@h)
	$2 = new nick
	Return code not checked.

		get the nick change.


module_modulename_on_JOIN

	Called when someone joins a channel the bot is in
	$1 = who did it (n!u@h)

	Called when someone parts a channel the bot is in
	$1 = who did it (n!u@h)
	$2 = what channel
	$3 = a reason if one exists.
	Return code not checked.
		Reason: A module with a list of users could get desynced if it didn't
		get the part.


module_modulename_on_KICK

module_modulename_before_disconnect
	Called when the bot is about to disconnect from server.
	The bot may or may not reconnect after this depending on what caused this.
	Note that this won't be called if the disconnect wasn't planned, like
	a ping timeout, getting killed, and so on.
	the disconnect.
	No parameters.
	Return code not checked.


module_modulename_after_disconnect
	Called when the bot gets disconnected from server.
	The bot may or may not reconnect after this depending on what caused
	the disconnect.
	No parameters.
	Return code not checked.
		Reason: A module may need clean up, don't let it desync.


module_modulename_on_RAW
	Called when the bot gets *ANY* line from the server after the initial connect.
	With this a module can hook onto something not supported by a more specific hook.
	The downsides:
	* Potentially speed as it has to be called for any message.
	* You have to parse more on your own.
	* You can desync other modules! Imagine a module that keep a list of
	  users in the channel. If you swallow a message about a join, part,
	  quit, nickchange, or other ones it may get desynced!
	* Even worse, you can desync the bot itself if you swallow NICK, JOIN
	  PART, KICK or possibly others. Or make it ping out by swallowing PING.
	Parameters:
		$1 = The raw line
	Return code:
		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.
		    For raw this means no normal hooks
		    will be called on the line either.

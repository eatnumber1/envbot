Module API
==========

This file contains info needed to write a module.

File name
---------

The module should follow this pattern:
m_modulename.sh
Example:
m_faq.sh

Variables
---------
All bash variables in the module that are global MUST follow the format
module_modulename_variablename to prevent overwriting other modules, or
global bot variables. FAQ module may use: module_faq_last_query for example
as a variable.

Variables that are local to the function (using the local directive) may have
other names. Don't forget variables created in for loops and such
(for foo in bar bash; do echo $foo; done the $foo variable is global here,
 do local foo on the line before it)


Functions and hooks
-------------------
Hooks are functions with special names, as listed below in the section "The hooks".

Each function or hook should start with the module_ followed by the module name.
So if the module is faq.sh the modules should start with module_faq_ like module_faq_INIT.

All bash functions in the module MUST follow the format
module_modulename_functionname to prevent overwriting other modules, or
global bot functions.

If not mentioned otherwise the hook is optional.
Functions marked with TODO may change, get renamed or removed and may not work
even in current code.


The hooks
---------
module_modulename_INIT (REQUIRED)
	Called directly after loading the module.
	Parameters:
		None
	Return status:
		If return status isn't 0 the module is considered as failed to load.
	Return on STDOUT:
		On STDOUT should be returned a space separated list of the optional functions
		that the module implements. FAQ would return "before_connect on_PRIVMSG"


module_modulename_UNLOAD (REQUIRED)
	Called to make the module unload itself.
	In this function it should clean up after itself and undefine all
	it's functions and variables except the hook functions.
	The unload function and other hook functions will be undefined
	after unload finished.
	The module may or may not get reloaded after this.
	Parameters:
		None
	Return status:
		0 = Unloaded correctly
		1 = Failed to unload. On this the bot will quit.
	Notes:
		This function is NOT called when the bot is exiting. To check for that
		use the FINALISE hook!


module_modulename_REHASH (REQUIRED)
	Called to make the module reparse any config options.
	Parameters:
		None
	Return status:
		0 = Rehashed correctly
		1 = Non fatal error for the bot itself. The bot will call UNLOAD on the module.
		2 = Fatal error of some kind. On this the bot will quit.


module_modulename_FINALISE
	Called directly before the bot quits. The bot has already closed
	the connection to the IRC server at this point. This is for saving
	stuff.
	Parameters:
		None
	Return status:
		Not checked.


module_modulename_after_load
	Called after all the hooks are added for the module.
	Parameters:
		None
	Return status:
		0 = Unloaded correctly
		1 = Failed. On this the bot will call unload on the module.
	Notes:
		This is useful for stuff that needs to echo log messages
		as that can't be done in modulename_INIT.


module_modulename_before_connect
	Called before the bot connected.
	Parameters:
		None
	Return status:
		Not checked.


module_modulename_on_connect
	Called for each line that the bot
	receives from the server during connecting.
	Parameters:
		$1 = Raw line.
	Return status:
		Not checked.


module_modulename_after_connect
	Called after the bot connected.
	Parameters:
		None
	Return status:
		Not checked.


module_modulename_periodic
	Called regularly for periodic events.
	Parameters:
		$1 = Timestamp when calling of hook started. This is to prevent
		     functions from having to do a slow call to date themself.
	Return code:
		Not checked.
	Notes:
		This function should be low overhead, it gets called quite often.
		Lower limit of time (during normal operation) between running hook:
			$envbot_transport_timeout seconds
		Upper limit of time (during normal operation) between running hook:
			2 * $envbot_transport_timeout seconds
		If there is some slow hook or code elsewhere this may result in that
		this hook does not get called within the bounds given above.


module_modulename_on_PRIVMSG
	Called when bot gets a PRIVMSG
	Parameters:
		$1 = From who (n!u@h)
		$2 = To who (channel or botnick)
		$3 = The message
	Return code:
		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.


module_modulename_on_NOTICE
	Called when bot gets a NOTICE
	Parameters:
		$1 = From who (n!u@h)
		$2 = To who (channel or botnick)
		$3 = The message
	Return code:
		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.


module_modulename_on_INVITE (new in 0.0.1-beta5)
	Called when bot gets an INVITE

		$1 = From who (n!u@h)
		$2 = Target nick (probably our own nick).

module_modulename_on_NICK
	Called when someone changes nick in a channel the bot is in
	Parameters:
		$1 = From who (n!u@h)
		$2 = New nick
	Return status:

			Reason: A module with a list of users could get desynced if it didn't
			get the nick change.


module_modulename_on_JOIN
	Called when someone joins a channel the bot is in
	Parameters:
		$1 = Who did it (n!u@h)

module_modulename_on_PART
	Called when someone parts a channel the bot is in
	Parameters:
		$1 = Who did it (n!u@h)
		$2 = What channel
		$3 = A reason if one exists.

	Parameters:
		$1 = Who did it (n!u@h).
		$2 = What channel.
		$3 = Who got kicked.
		$4 = A reason if one exists.

	Parameters:
		$1 = Who did it (n!u@h).
		$2 = What channel.
		$3 = New topic.
	Return status:
		Not checked.
			Reason: We don't want to get desynced modules.


module_modulename_on_channel_MODE
	Called when someone changes a mode in the channel
	Parameters:
		$1 = Who did it (n!u@h).
		$2 = On what channel.
		$3 = The mode change with it's parameters.

		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.
	Notes:
		In most cases you DON'T want to return 1 for this. If you do be very very careful.


module_modulename_on_server_ERROR
	# ERROR :Closing link (rfc3092@1.2.3.4) [Killed (AnMaster (testing a kill on inspircd))]
	# ERROR :Closing Link: [1.2.3.4] (Throttled: Reconnecting too fast) -Email staff@example.com for more information.
	# ERROR :Closing Link: envbot[host.name.se] Brain ([hurricane.KuoNET.org] Local kill by Brain (testing kill on unrealircd))
	# ERROR :Closing Link: envbot[host.name.se] hurricane.KuoNET.org (Killed (Brain (testing kill on unrealircd, remote one)))
	Called when the bot get an ERROR from the server.
	Parameters:
		$1 = The ERROR message.
	Return status:
		Not checked.
			Reason: There isn't much point in swallowing this.


module_modulename_on_KILL
	Called when the bot get a KILL message from the server.
	Parameters:
		$1 = The sender of the kill.
		$2 = The target of the kill.
		$3 = The KILL path.
		$4 = The reason.
	Return status:
		Not checked.
			Reason: Risk for desync of modules.


module_modulename_before_disconnect
	Called when the bot is about to disconnect from server.
	The bot may or may not reconnect after this depending on what caused this.
	the disconnect.
	Parameters:
		None
	Return status:
		Not checked.
	Notes:
		This won't be called if the disconnect wasn't planned, like
		a ping timeout, getting killed, and so on.


module_modulename_after_disconnect
	Called when the bot gets disconnected from server.
	The bot may or may not reconnect after this depending on what caused
	the disconnect.
	Parameters:
		None
	Return status:
		Not checked.
			Reason: A module may need clean up, don't let it desync.


module_modulename_on_RAW
	Called when the bot gets *ANY* line from the server after the initial connect.
	With this a module can hook onto something not supported by a more specific hook.
	The downsides:
	* Potentially speed as it has to be called for any message.
	* You have to parse more on your own.
	* You can desync other modules! Imagine a module that keep a list of
	  users in the channel. If you swallow a message about a join, part,
	  quit, nickchange, or other ones it may get desynced!
	* Even worse, you can desync the bot itself if you swallow NICK, JOIN
	  PART, KICK or possibly others. Or make it ping out by swallowing PING.
	Parameters:
		$1 = The raw line
	Return status:
		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.
		    For raw this means no normal hooks
		    will be called on the line either.

This file describes the functions that should be in a module.
Each function should start with the module name.
So if the module is faq.sh the modules should start with faq_ like faq_INIT.

If not mentioned otherwise the function is optional.

modulename_INIT (REQUIERD)
	Called directly after loading the module. No parameters.
	If return code isn't 0 the module is considered as failed to load.
	The module should clean up after itself in this case.
	On STDOUT should be returned a space separated list of functions the 
	module implements. FAQ would return "before_connect on_PRIVMSG"

modulename_before_connect
	If implemented, called before the bot connected.
	No parameters
	Return code not checked.
	Note: This is useful for stuff that needs to echo log messages
	      as that can't be done in modulename_INIT.

modulename_after_connect
	If implemented, called after the bot connected.
	No parameters
	Return code not checked.

modulename_on_PRIVMSG
	Called when bot gets a PRIVMSG
	$1 = from who (n!u@h)
	$2 = to who (channel or botnick)
	$3 = the message
	Return code:
		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.

modulename_on_NOTICE
	Called when bot gets a NOTICE
	$1 = from who (n!u@h)
	$2 = to who (channel or botnick)
	$3 = the message
	Return code:
		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.

modulename_on_RAW
	Called when the bot gets *ANY* line from the server after the inital connect.
	With this a module can hook onto something not supported by a more specific hook.
	The downsides:
	* Potentially speed as it has to be called for any message.
	* You have to parse more on your own.
	Parameters:
		$1 = The raw line
	Return code:
		0 = pass it on to next module
		1 = I have taken care of this, and don't
		    consult other modules about this.
		    For raw this means no normal hooks
		    will be called on the line either.

  bzr log -rtag:0.0.1-beta1.. --short


0.0.1-beta2
-----------
379:       Actually more than one space between parameters on irc is possible, yes that sucks, and no sane server would send it, but just to be on the safe side
377:       Added this ChangeLog.
376:       Fix potential security problem in sql cleaning code in module_sqlite3_clean_string (I can't find a way to abuse this so I don't think the risk is very high)
375:       Add access_log_action()
373-375:   Introduced more advanced logging API with several levels (info, warn, error and fatal)
371:       Optimize log_write() in lib/log.sh (something like 20 times as fast now if my testing is correct)


0.0.1-beta1
-----------
First version, no ChangeLog as there is nothing to older to list changes against.

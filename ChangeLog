0.0.1-beta5
-----------
450        Merged r451 from trunk: Fix broken misc_clean_spaces (was broken after beta4).
443        Made parse_hostmask_*() faster and added some missing quotes.
441        Found that an INVITE hook was missing, added it.
430-435    Added more numerics.
429        Workaround for bug #21 added (Own nick desync during connect with ghost).


0.0.1-beta4
-----------
424        Config version update: Added $config_log_raw. Defines if we should log raw lines or not (affects both STDOUT and logfiles)
420,423    misc_clean_spaces was slow, changed to inline ways of stripping spaces.
416        Got rid of deprecated parse_get_colon_arg function.
415        Added some code to check for stuff that matches no hook, and found that there is no umode change hook because of this. Fixed.
411        Made assignment of factoids work if there is more than one separator in string, yes this may be slower but it works.
410        Fixed bug in factoids with forget command not reporting "I didn't have a factoid matching..." when none was found.


0.0.1-beta3
-----------
407        Make error messages in transports more verbose.
402-406    Make m_calc.sh check it's arguments on IRC better to make it secure.
401        Fix bug that made modules_load break if a dependency failed to load.
398        Made main envbot a wrapper script that sanitize the environment and then executes main bot.
395        Some more functions are now internal in lib/log.sh, modules should use the log level versions.
393        m_autojoin was slowing down rehash more than needed, fixed that.
392        Fixed: Could not unload rehash, module_rehash_UNLOAD returned 127!
391        Fixed bug that caused FINALISE hooks to never run
383        Add bash version check (it turned out bash-3.1 and older was not supported).


0.0.1-beta2
-----------
379        Actually more than one space between parameters on IRC is possible, yes that sucks, and no sane server would send it, but just to be on the safe side
377        Added this ChangeLog.
376        Fixed potential security problem in SQL cleaning code in module_sqlite3_clean_string (I can't find a way to abuse this so I don't think the risk is very high)
375        Added access_log_action()
373-375    Introduced more advanced logging API with several levels (info, warn, error and fatal)
371        Optimized log_write() in lib/log.sh (something like 20 times as fast now if my testing is correct)


0.0.1-beta1
-----------
First version, no ChangeLog as there is nothing to older to list changes against.

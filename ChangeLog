0.1-beta1
---------
A lot is new in this release. Some of the highlights include:
 * Help command.
 * Coloured log output.
 * Modules that is split over several files in a subdirectory.
   See contrib/modules/m_perl for an example.
 * Lots of speed improvements by avoiding subshells when possible and such.
 * Checks in subshells that module loading will work before actually loading it.
   This is to avoid crashes on syntax errors in modules and such.
 * A new centralised bot command dispatching system that is easier to use
   than the old on_PRIVMSG and having every module parse it by itself.
 * API documentation is now auto generated from source code using bashdoc.
 * Extended and reworked internal API.
 * New more flexible module API.
 * Many new modules.
   * Core:
     * commands     - List commands from each module.
     * ctcp         - Responds to CTCPs send to the bot.
     * dice         - Roll a dice.
     * help         - Help command.
     * karma        - Karma module (the common ++/-- stuff)
     * nicktracking - tracks nicks <-> host mapping for channels the bot is in.
     * ping         - Provide some latency info and such.
     * uptime       - Tell the uptime of the bot.
   * Contrib (these either need extra deps or are not supported by the developers):
     * convert      - Convert between different units (needs GNU or BSD units installed).
     * perl         - Run perl code (not supported because it may not be safe).
 * Lots of bugfixes.

The rest of this change log entry is mainly for developers wanting to port their
code from 0.0.1 to 0.1:
 * 0.0.1 modules won't work without change, the both the module and core APIs
   have changed a lot. For example on_PRIVMSG should not be used now most of the
   time, instead see commands_register function.
   See doc/module_api2.txt and the auto generated API docs for details.
 * Quite a few Core API functions have changed parameter format:
   A lot now take "out parameters" instead of using $() construct. This is
   because subshells (caused by the $() construct) are slow.
 * Sadly one feature from trunk were too unstable to make it into 0.1, it will
   hopefully be in the next version. This feature was periodic events. This is
   the reason for some odd code related to transports status in this version
   ($transport_status and transport_alive to be specific).

443        Made parse_hostmask_*() faster and added some missing quotes.

430-435    Added more numerics.
429        Workaround for bug #21 added (Own nick desync during connect with ghost).


0.0.1-beta4
-----------
424        Config version update: Added $config_log_raw. Defines if we should log raw lines or not (affects both STDOUT and logfiles)
420,423    misc_clean_spaces was slow, changed to inline ways of stripping spaces.
416        Got rid of deprecated parse_get_colon_arg function.
415        Added some code to check for stuff that matches no hook, and found that there is no umode change hook because of this. Fixed.
411        Made assignment of factoids work if there is more than one separator in string, yes this may be slower but it works.
410        Fixed bug in factoids with forget command not reporting "I didn't have a factoid matching..." when none was found.


0.0.1-beta3
-----------
407        Make error messages in transports more verbose.
402-406    Make m_calc.sh check it's arguments on IRC better to make it secure.

398        Made main envbot a wrapper script that sanitise the environment and then executes main bot.
395        Some more functions are now internal in lib/log.sh, modules should use the log level versions.
393        m_autojoin was slowing down rehash more than needed, fixed that.
392        Fixed: Could not unload rehash, module_rehash_UNLOAD returned 127!
391        Fixed bug that caused FINALISE hooks to never run

0.0.1-beta2
-----------
379        Actually more than one space between parameters on IRC is possible, yes that sucks, and no sane server would send it, but just to be on the safe side
377        Added this ChangeLog.
376        Fixed potential security problem in SQL cleaning code in module_sqlite3_clean_string (I can't find a way to abuse this so I don't think the risk is very high)
375        Added access_log_action()
373-375    Introduced more advanced logging API with several levels (info, warn, error and fatal)
371        Optimised log_write() in lib/log.sh (something like 20 times as fast now if my testing is correct)


0.0.1-beta1
-----------
First version, no ChangeLog as there is nothing to older to list changes against.

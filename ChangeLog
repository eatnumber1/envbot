0.0.1-beta3
-----------
407:       Make error messages in transports more verbose.
402-406:   Make m_calc.sh check it's arguments on IRC better to make it secure.
401:       Fix bug that made modules_load break if a dependency failed to load.
398:       Made main envbot a wrapper script that sanitize the environment and then executes main bot.
395:       Some more functions are now internal in lib/log.sh, modules should use the log level versions.
393:       m_autojoin was slowing down rehash more than needed, fixed that.
392:       Fixed: Could not unload rehash, module_rehash_UNLOAD returned 127!
391:       Fix bug that caused FINALISE hooks to never run
383:       Add bash version check (it turned out bash-3.1 and older was not supported).

0.0.1-beta2
-----------
379:       Actually more than one space between parameters on irc is possible, yes that sucks, and no sane server would send it, but just to be on the safe side
377:       Added this ChangeLog.
376:       Fix potential security problem in sql cleaning code in module_sqlite3_clean_string (I can't find a way to abuse this so I don't think the risk is very high)
375:       Add access_log_action()
373-375:   Introduced more advanced logging API with several levels (info, warn, error and fatal)
371:       Optimize log_write() in lib/log.sh (something like 20 times as fast now if my testing is correct)


0.0.1-beta1
-----------
First version, no ChangeLog as there is nothing to older to list changes against.

Installing envbot
=================

Installation isn't needed, you can run it from source directory.
Installation is possible though, but not recommended.

All you have to do is to get the bot running is:
* Run:
    make
* Copy bot_settings.sh.example to bot_settings.sh
* Edit bot_settings.sh to set correct nick, IRC server, service password, and so on.
* Run:
    ./envbot

To install use something like (change the paths to fit your system):
make install DESTDIR=/ PREFIX=/home/user/envbot
